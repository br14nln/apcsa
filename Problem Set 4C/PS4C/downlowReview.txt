Came here tonight with some friends for an event so decided to have dinner here beforehand. It's my first time here, but my 3 friends have been here before. The atmosphere and energy in the place was fun and upbeat. When I told the cashier it's my first time, please explain to me the level of spicy that comes with the chicken....he yelled "we got a first timer here!", and everyone in the back kitchen started shouting and cheering. That was different and created a fun atmosphere. Let's get down to the chicken review. I ordered 2 piece with fries for $16.90, since I already had a drink in hand from somewhere else. I got it medium spicy. The chicken came with a slice of white bread underneath!? I was too carbed out to eat the bread. The seasoning and spice on the chicken was very tasty. It wasn't spicy at all, I liked the aroma. The fries were over fried, cause I don't taste the potato in it. Fortunately the seasoning made it easier to eat, so because of that I gave 5 stars for food since there's no 4.5 stars. My friends all got the chicken sandwich or the waffle burger.....they loved it. Guess next time I will try a burger.
